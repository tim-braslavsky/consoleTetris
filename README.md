# Console Tetris
![Alt Text](https://i.imgur.com/obJ3i4A.gif)

This is a project based off One Lone Coder's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OK8_tHeCIA).
This is a fully functional game of tetris entirely in the console, using nothing but asccii characters.

-The difficulty and scoring is baseed off the NES version of tetris.

-I also added projection of where the piece will be placed that helps with the fact that characters are not perfect squares.

*Feel free to download, play and modify as you see fit. This was a project for learning and fun only.*
